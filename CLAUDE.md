# FitQuest — Fitness RPG Development Guide

## Project Overview

A gamified fitness web app built as a full Fitness × Fantasy RPG hybrid. Players log real-world workouts to earn XP, level up a character, unlock gear, complete quests, and battle enemies.

**Stack:** Next.js 15 (App Router) · React 18 · TypeScript 5 · Tailwind CSS · Firebase (Firestore + Auth) · Zustand · Recharts

**Firebase project:** `fitness-rpg-claude`

**Key paths:**

- `src/app/(game)/` — all game screens (dashboard, activities, quests, combat, character, shop, stats, inventory, profile)
- `src/app/(auth)/` — login / register
- `src/components/` — shared UI components
- `src/lib/` — Firebase init + game logic utilities
- `src/store/` — Zustand stores (character, inventory, quests, stats, dungeon)
- `src/types/` — TypeScript definitions
- `src/hooks/` — custom React hooks
- `src/middleware.ts` — route protection
- `docs/` — engineering references: [ARCHITECTURE](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [FIRESTORE](docs/FIRESTORE.md), [CI](docs/CI.md), [GAME-LOGIC](docs/GAME-LOGIC.md), [SECURITY-SETUP](docs/SECURITY-SETUP.md), [SMOKE-TEST](docs/SMOKE-TEST.md), [CHANGELOG](docs/CHANGELOG.md), [UI-UX-MODERNIZATION](docs/UI-UX-MODERNIZATION.md), [ART-ASSETS](docs/ART-ASSETS.md), [BACKLOG](docs/BACKLOG.md)

## Current Status (last updated 2026-05-25 — B5/B6: gear equip max-only, unequip clamps current)

**Shipped:** MVP phases 1–5 + Spells (21-spell catalog, dice resolution) + Streaks/PRs (Blessing tiers, 1.5× PR XP) + Subclasses (6, level-10 unlock) + Profile analytics + R1 streak boost transparency in victory modal + R4-StageB `logActivity` Cloud Function (server-side daily-cap enforcement, mastery writes) + R4-StageC restore migration (HP/Stamina/Magic capped at formula-derived max server-side) + CI Firestore rules auto-deploy. Code-audit sweeps to 10/10 — full architecture contract (lib wrappers for Firestore/Auth/Cloud Functions via `src/lib/{auth,functions,fetchPlayerData,characterData,activityData,questData,inventoryData,combatData,errors}.ts`), Firestore field normalizers (safe defaults for post-MVP schema fields), store-first reads on stats page, parallel equipment writes in `awardLoot`, combat `useMemo` hoisting, `useCharacter` 30 s TTL with `force` bypass, stat-alloc two-click confirmation, auth form a11y (`id`/`htmlFor`/`autoComplete`), `rotationExpiresAt()`, `(uid, loggedAt DESC)` Firestore index deployed, `rewardedXp`/`rewardedGold` stamped at quest claim, `legendaryDryStreak` Firestore rule validation, Cloud Functions vitest suite, Playwright E2E smoke suite (14 tests), CI updated with functions tests + E2E steps + combined `firestore:rules,indexes` auto-deploy, stats page analytics dashboard (stacked XP chart, Battles Won card, error state, 1000-log limit). **Dungeons** — 4-tier multi-room runs (Goblin Caves/Spider Lair/Dark Sanctum/Dragon's Keep), seeded weekly layouts, stat-check/rest/boss rooms, enrage mechanics, venom DoT, 12 exclusive items, legendary lockout, `claimDungeonRun` CF for atomic rewards. **Achievements** — 6 dungeon badges (Initiate, 4 tier clears, Legendary Haul), gold rewards awarded atomically inside `claimDungeonRun` CF transaction (no race window), parity-tested CF copy, achievement gold breakdown in victory screen, profile badge gallery. **UI/UX modernization** — all 24 items from the original ui-critic audit landed (display font, dark mode, custom heraldic art system, PWA install, sound, design tokens, combat scene redesign, illustrated backgrounds). **Dark mode audit pass** — `InputField` canonical input component (`dark:bg-slate-950`, `sm`/`md`/`lg` variants) introduced; all 14 raw `<input>` elements migrated; comprehensive `dark:` patch across 16 components and pages (stat alloc modal, spell cards, combat dice, shop/inventory/quest/stats tinted surfaces); Playwright E2E dark-mode guard added to `tests/e2e/dark-mode.test.ts`. **Balance backlog cleared** — P0/P1/P2 all shipped, including P0-3 `claimCombatVictory` Cloud Function (server-authoritative daily combat XP cap: 1.0× wins 1–9 → 0.5× wins 10–19 → 0.25× wins 20–29 → 0.1× wins 30+; gold never diminished; parity-tested client/server multiplier; combat page shows live "Daily combat XP" badge). **Combat bug fixes (2026-05-22)** — per-step claim isolation in `handleClaimRewards` (B1: modal closes on CF success, no double-award window, loot-only failures get warning toast); spell action button visible in light mode at disabled state (B2: explicit slate disabled colours replace opacity-40); dark mode in `BattleResultsModal` and in-battle victory banner (B3: white gradients patched, "Drop Only" badge, `BattleLogEntry` border). **Premium spell cards (2026-05-22)** — `PremiumSpellCard` wrapper adds rarity-depth box-shadow, hover lift, and mouse-tracking shimmer (mix-blend-mode: screen); zero re-renders on mousemove via DOM ref mutation; `willChange` promoted only on hover; all 4 SpellCard callsites swapped. **V4 item silhouettes + per-item unique art (2026-05-23)** — `EntityArt category="item"` portraits added to gear/consumable cards in shop and inventory. 45 unique SVG silhouettes authored (18 weapons, 13 armor, 14 accessories) keyed by `item.id`; weapons/armor use `'shield'` frame, accessories use `'medallion'`; no emoji fallbacks. **Reliability & polish sprint** — `lib/retry.ts` (`fetchWithRetry<T>`, `isRetryable`, `STORE_RETRY_DELAYS = [1_000, 3_000]`) wired into all 5 store fetch paths; stale cap meter (spinner + 50% opacity while re-fetching, clears on error instead of deleting entry); double-fetch fix in `ActivityLogForm` submit handler (stale-mark pattern instead of delete + manual refresh); `utcDayStartMs(date?)` helper extracted to `streaks.ts` with injectable date param on `fetchTodayLogsForType`; Firestore IndexedDB offline persistence (`persistentLocalCache` + `persistentMultipleTabManager`) with SSR + hot-reload guards; sign-out store flush for all 5 stores; `npm audit fix` (brace-expansion + qs vulns patched). 3D tumbling dice + phased roll sounds (V1+V2) (2026-05-22). **CSP + Die3D + emulator sprint (2026-05-23)** — CSP `connect-src` was missing `https://*.cloudfunctions.net`, blocking all Cloud Function calls (`claimCombatVictory`, `logActivity`) at the browser level; fixed alongside `worker-src blob:` for canvas-confetti. `Die3D` extended with `format='number'`, `size='xl'`, and `color` prop; `ActionRollOverlay` migrated from removed `D10Face` — all combat dice now use the 3D cube. `firebase.ts` emulator support completed with `connectFunctionsEmulator` (port 5001). **Stability-to-A sprint (2026-05-23)** — `OfflineBanner` copy updated to accurately describe Firestore's queued-write replay behaviour on reconnect. New `tests/e2e/global-setup.ts` seeds an Auth + Firestore emulator test user/character via REST API and saves Playwright `storageState`; new `tests/e2e/authenticated.test.ts` smoke-tests 9 game routes via the saved storage state; `playwright.config.ts` gained a second `authenticated` project that applies the storage state; CI now starts the auth+firestore emulators before E2E and passes `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_FIREBASE_EMULATOR=true`. `scripts/audit-check.mjs` replaces the two `continue-on-error` `npm audit` steps — fails the build on any high/critical vulnerability, logs moderates as warnings (firebase-tools transitive uuid<9 chain documented in `docs/SECURITY-SETUP.md § Known devDependency vulnerabilities`). `@next/bundle-analyzer` wired up behind `npm run analyze`. Item silhouettes (55 SVG functions + `ITEM_SILHOUETTES` map, ~1030 lines) moved out of `silhouettes.tsx` into new `src/components/art/item-silhouettes.tsx`, so non-item routes (combat/character/dashboard) no longer pay the cost in their shared chunk. **Dungeon ↔ arena combat parity (2026-05-24)** — dungeon combat rooms now expose the full arena action set (Attack, Magic, Roll Ability 6d6, Cast Spell, Rest, Meditate, Use Item, Flee) with full passive / lifesteal / crit / execute / momentum / per-round-restore integration on every action. Previously dungeons were attack-and-flee only and even basic attacks bypassed `applyOutgoingPassives` and `resolveLifesteal`, leaving subclass builds inert inside dungeons. Refactor extracts a shared combat layer used by both pages: new `src/components/combat/` surface (overlays + action bar + log + portraits + types), new `src/lib/gameLogic/combatActions.ts` pure resolvers, new `src/hooks/useCombatEncounter.ts` hook. Arena page shrank ~1,000 lines. Dungeon page mounts the hook for combat/boss phases and keeps stat-check / rest / transition / boss-victory / defeat phases as today. Dungeon-only mechanics (Venom DoT, Necro Shield, Dragon ignore-DEF, Broodmother +ATK, boss-room Flee disable) inject via a new `CombatModifiers` seam — arena passes `undefined`, every hook short-circuits to identity (zero behaviour change for arena). `useCombatEncounter` is store-agnostic: `onResourceChange` is a local-mirror-only signal, Firestore writes happen exactly once per encounter inside `onVictory` / `onDefeat` / `onFlee`. Arena keeps `claimCombatVictoryCF`, dungeon keeps `advanceRoom` per cleared room + `claimDungeonRunCF` at boss-victory claim. 15 new vitest specs cover each resolver + every modifier hook slot (arena-equivalence test confirms `modifiers: undefined` produces identical state deltas to the legacy inline handlers). 666 total tests pass; suite still under 15 s. **Test coverage expansion (2026-05-23)** — 24 new vitest files (215 new tests, 438 → 653; suite still under 12 s). Coverage: `characterStore` (41 tests — fetch TTL, level-up bonuses, stat-allocation caps, subclass gating at level 10, monster pity reset/increment, mastery local-apply, restore local-apply, name updates), `dungeonStore` (19 — legacy claimed-run cleanup, startRun gating on HP/gold/daily limit, advanceRoom accumulation, completeRun CF-finalized fast-path), `statsStore` (10 — TTL cache, retry flag, error capture). `useCharacter`, `useOnlineStatus`, `useCombatBursts`, `useRecentActivity`. `characterData.normalizeCharacter` (required-field validation + post-MVP defaults), `questData.normalizeActiveQuest`, `inventoryData.normalizeInventoryItem`, `combatData`, `dungeonData` (all 7 exports), `auth` (signIn / signUp / logOut / verifyBeforeUpdateEmail / updatePassword / updateProfile), `functions.claimDungeonRunCF` idempotent-no-op for `functions/already-exists`, `errors.captureError`. Components: `InputField`, `Button`, `XPBar`, `EmptyState`, `ErrorBanner`, `OfflineBanner`, `Heading`, `Card`, `Modal` (a11y attrs, Escape closes, body-scroll lock). `vitest.config.ts` `coverage.include` broadened to `src/lib/**`, `src/store/**`, `src/hooks/**`, `src/components/**/*.{ts,tsx}`; thresholds remain gated only on `src/lib/gameLogic/**` (80/80/70/80). `@vitejs/plugin-react` added as a devDep so vitest 4 / rolldown can parse JSX in `.tsx` test files.

**Deferred items (not blocking, revisit when applicable):**

- `uuid` vulns (7 moderate) inside `firebase-tools` transitive deps — `npm audit fix --force` would install `firebase-tools@1.2.0` (breaking); watch Firebase CLI release notes and run `npm update firebase-tools` on a branch when a Node-24-compatible fix lands. CI now logs these as warnings via `scripts/audit-check.mjs` rather than blocking the build (high/critical still block). Documented in `docs/SECURITY-SETUP.md § Known devDependency vulnerabilities`
- IndexedDB quota on mobile — browser can evict the cache below ~50 MB on low-storage devices; monitor if user base grows to mobile-first audience
- `resource-exhausted` jitter — retries currently use fixed delays; exponential back-off with jitter would reduce thundering-herd if the app ever has concurrent users; not warranted at current scale

**Spell-card front/back flip (2026-05-24)** — `PremiumSpellCard` becomes an MTG-style flippable card. New `SpellCardBack` component renders a uniform "FitQuest Spellbook" reverse face: rarity-tinted border + header band + footer plate matching the front silhouette, with a central hexagonal `HeraldicFrame` sigil (sword-and-spark glyph) ringed by five colored magic-school orbs (heal/defense/stun/damage/lifesteal) in an MTG-pentagon layout. Click the card body to flip; flip and the existing hover-tilt compose on one inner element via `transform-style: preserve-3d` + `backface-visibility: hidden`. `role="button"`, `aria-pressed`, Enter/Space keyboard flip, and `useReducedMotion` from framer-motion gates the 600 ms cubic-bezier transition. The action button (Buy/Equip/Cast) stops click propagation so it never triggers a flip. All 4 callsites (shop, inventory loadout × 2, combat selector) inherit the flip with zero API change. 674 total tests pass (+8 specs in `PremiumSpellCard.test.tsx`).

**Bugs & enhancements backlog kickoff (2026-05-25)** — `docs/BUGS-ENHANCEMENTS.md` cataloged 9 bugs and 8 enhancements from a player report. **B1 quest reroll `deleteField()` fix** is the first item shipped: `src/store/questStore.ts` now imports `deleteField` from `firebase/firestore` and uses it (not `undefined`) in the `updateActiveQuestDoc` payload when the rolled quest has no `extraTargets`. Previously this branch threw `FirebaseError: Unsupported field value: undefined (found in field extraProgress …)` and the reroll button effectively crashed for any active quest where the candidate pool included a single-target definition. Local Zustand state keeps `undefined` (valid JS) — only the Firestore payload needed the sentinel. Two new vitest specs in `src/store/__tests__/questStore.test.ts` cover both branches of `rerollQuest` (deleteField path + `{}` path) via a deterministic candidate constraint that holds every pool entry except the desired target. 684 total tests pass (+10 since the spell-card flip merge baseline of 674).

**Active focus:** Feature backlog kick-off — balance & engine fixes are complete; combat layer is now unified between arena and dungeons. Next surface is the Achievements page (full catalog with progress hints), then the Reputation / Wanted Board (the foundation currency that gates Champions, Guilds, Pets, Monthly NPCs, Raids).

**Next priorities (post-MVP backlog, prioritized):**

### Balance & engine fixes (from game-systems-audit spec — fix before adding features)

- ~~**P0-1** — Unify monster counter-attack formula~~ — verified already flat (`monster.attack − effectivePlayerDef`); no change needed
- ~~**P0-2** — Monster XP scaling cliff at level 10~~ — shipped: `monsterXpScaling(playerLevel, monsterLevel)` adds +8%/level over the monster for top-tier (level ≥ 8) monsters, capped at 2.0×
- ~~**P0-3** — Daily combat XP cap / diminishing returns~~ — shipped: new `claimCombatVictory` Cloud Function applies a tiered multiplier (1.0× / 0.5× / 0.25× / 0.1×) at win counts 10 / 20 / 30. Gold never diminished. Combat page shows live "Daily combat XP" badge (emerald → amber → rose) with wins-until-next-penalty copy. Toast surfaces the multiplier on every penalized claim. `combatXpDailyMultiplier` lives in `src/lib/gameLogic/combat.ts` with parity copy in `functions/src/gameLogic/combat.ts` (parity test cross-checks the two for 0–100 wins). **Closes the post-MVP balance backlog — every P0/P1/P2 item is now shipped or verified-as-already-complete.**
- ~~**P1-1** — Steepen quest XP scaler~~ — shipped: `0.4 + 0.6·√l` (was `0.6 + 0.4·√l`); level-10 lifts 1.86× → 2.30×
- ~~**P1-2** — Raise Blessed tier streak XP multiplier 1.25× → 1.50×~~ — shipped
- ~~**P1-3** — Gold endgame sinks~~ — shipped: 100g quest reroll mechanic on every active QuestCard (excludes currently-held questDefIds for genuine variety); dungeon entry fees verified already deducted
- ~~**P1-4** — Fizzle stamina refund~~ — shipped: `COMBAT.FIZZLE_STAMINA_REFUND = 5` returned on failed ability roll
- ~~**P1-5** — Add level-9 monster (Lich King)~~ — shipped: HP 150 / atk 28 / def 9 / xp 220 / gold 110 with necromancer loot table
- ~~**P1-6** — Dungeon resource persistence~~ — verified already complete: `DungeonRun` doc carries `currentHp` / `currentStamina` / `currentMagic`; `dungeonStore.advanceRoom()` persists them; `bootstrap()` on the run page restores them; `enterRoom()` does not reset player resources. Audit framing was outdated.
- ~~**P2-1** — Mastery linked-stat hint on activity log form~~ — shipped: inline indigo callout shows the activity → stat mapping for workout / run / steps tabs
- ~~**P2-2** — Wizard starting stats~~ — shipped: starting health 6 → 8
- ~~**P2-3** — Activity cap proximity indicator on the log form~~ — shipped: subscribes to last-50 logs, computes today's total via UTC-day filter, shows a coloured cap meter (emerald → amber at 70% → rose when exhausted). Two helpers (`remainingCapacityForActivity`, `dailyCapUsageFraction`) with 7 new unit tests.
- ~~**P2-4** — Quest reroll mechanic~~ — shipped alongside P1-3 (100g per reroll, excludes held questDefIds). Quest pool expansion deferred — current pool (28 daily / 14 weekly) already supports variety.

### Feature backlog (dependency order — each unlocks the next)

1. **Achievements page** — `/character/achievements` full catalog with locked/unlocked states (badge gallery exists on profile; this adds the dedicated view with descriptions and progress hints)
2. **Reputation / Wanted Board** — foundation currency for all social/endgame features; daily bounties from the Wanted Board, Reputation tiers with stat bonuses; spec: `2026-05-17-future-features-roadmap-design.md`
3. **Champions** — 10-champion roster, dungeon deployment, injury/recovery system, 7 archetypes (Warrior/Mage/Rogue/Ranger/Paladin/Necromancer/Bard), pip-dot cooldown UI; spec: `2026-05-17-champions-reputation-streaks-design.md`; requires Reputation
4. **Guilds** — level-15 unlock, activity-aligned XP drip, rank milestones, exclusive gear; requires Reputation
5. **Pets** — milestone/birthday unlock, 3 active slots, passive+active abilities scaled by rarity; requires Reputation/Champions groundwork
6. **Monthly NPCs** — 6 rotating NPCs with seeded challenge pools, permanent expiry after each month, level/reputation gates; requires Champions + Reputation
7. **Raids** — bi-weekly events, 5-day streak gate, 2+ champions required, god-tier loot, streak makeup mechanics; requires Champions + Guilds
8. **Territory / Map** — GPS-based zone claiming, PvP disputes with 3-day response window; long-horizon feature, requires all above
9. **Prestige / Ascension** — reset for permanent bonuses; design TBD (no spec yet)
10. **PWA** — installable mobile experience (no spec yet; can land independently)
11. **Apple Health integration** — auto-import workouts (no spec yet; can land independently)
12. **Leaderboards** — compare with other users (no spec yet; requires user growth)

**Update protocol:** when a feature ships, move it from "Next" to "Shipped", bump the date, and append an entry to [docs/CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md). This section in CLAUDE.md is the **canonical** status snapshot — `memory/project_state.md` no longer tracks status, only deep implementation details.

## How to Work

**Commands** (run from repo root):

- `npm run dev` — start dev server on `http://localhost:3000`
- `npm run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`. Fast TS-only check
- `npm run lint` — ESLint check
- `npm test` — `vitest run` (pure game-logic unit tests in `src/lib/gameLogic/__tests__/`)
- `npm run test:watch` — vitest in watch mode while developing
- `npm run test:coverage` — coverage report via `@vitest/coverage-v8`
- `npm run build` — production build. Catches everything above + build-time issues
- `npm run start` — serve the built output
- `npm run test:rules` — Firestore security-rules tests (requires Firebase emulator). Run via: `npx firebase emulators:exec --only firestore --project demo-fitness-rpg "npm run test:rules"`. **Java 11+ must be on `PATH`** — the emulator is a JVM process. Not needed for any other dev command.

**Runtime:** CI runs on Node 24. Node 20/22 still work locally but are not tested in CI — prefer Node 24 to match.

**Verification:**

- Unit tests cover pure game logic (combat, spells, xp). UI / behavior changes still must be verified manually in the browser — golden path _and_ edge cases. The Playwright suite (`tests/e2e/`) covers auth redirects, login/register form attributes, and dark-mode input backgrounds; it does **not** cover authenticated game screens (no Firebase emulator), so those still require manual verification
- New game-logic functions in `src/lib/gameLogic/` should ship with vitest tests when feasible
- Before opening a PR: hooks (`typecheck` + `lint` + `vitest run`) pass + manual browser verification of any UI/UX change
- CI runs the same checks via `.github/workflows/` on every push

**Firebase:** live project `fitness-rpg-claude`. No emulator setup; dev hits live Firestore. Be intentional about test data — it's real.

**Cloud Functions runtime:** `functions/package.json` pins `"node": "22"` — Firebase Cloud Functions does not yet support Node 24 in production (Node 22 is the current max). This intentionally lags behind the CI runtime (Node 24). Do not bump the functions engine version without first confirming Firebase support.

**EBADENGINE warning:** running `npm install` inside `functions/` on Node 24 prints `npm warn EBADENGINE … required: { node: '22' }`. This is expected — the engine pin is for the Firebase production runtime, not the local development environment. The warning is harmless and can be ignored.

**Changelog:** when a meaningful change ships on `master`, append an entry to [docs/CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md). Skip trivial (typos, comment-only). Keep newest-first. **The `CHANGELOG.md` edit must be committed inside the same feature PR** — never as a separate follow-up commit or PR after the feature has already merged, because the pre-push hook blocks direct pushes to `master`, forcing an unnecessary second PR.

## Development Partner Role

You are a **senior full-stack engineer and game systems designer** co-creating this product. Your job is not to blindly execute — it is to co-create, challenge, and elevate.

### Core Responsibilities

- Always aim for the best long-term solution, not the quickest fix
- Actively challenge assumptions, logic, and design decisions when something could be improved
- Think in terms of scalability, maintainability, and extensibility
- Balance engineering quality with engaging game design

---

## Code Quality Standards (MANDATORY)

- Produce clean, production-ready code — no placeholders or pseudo-code unless explicitly requested
- Follow consistent patterns across the entire codebase (naming, structure, hooks, state management)
- Prefer modular, reusable components and utilities
- Avoid duplication — abstract shared logic when appropriate
- No over-commenting — add a comment only when the WHY is non-obvious
- All code must be complete and directly usable
- When modifying a file, return the FULL updated file

### Naming Conventions

- Components: `PascalCase`
- Hooks: `useXxx`
- Utilities: `camelCase`
- Types/interfaces: `PascalCase`, prefixed with `I` for interfaces where ambiguous
- Zustand stores: `useXxxStore`
- Firebase collections: `camelCase` plural (e.g., `characters`, `activities`)

---

## UI / UX & Design Consistency

- Maintain the fitness + fantasy RPG aesthetic throughout
- Design should feel like a **game**, not a dashboard
- Use clear hierarchy, spacing, and alignment
- Required game UI patterns:
  - Progression feedback: XP bars, level indicators, stat numbers
  - Visual rewards: rarity color system, icons, micro-animations
  - Clear affordances: button states, loading states, feedback toasts
- Rarity color scale: Common (gray) → Uncommon (green) → Rare (blue) → Epic (purple) → Legendary (orange/gold)

---

## Game Design Principles

Think like a game designer, not just a developer. When adding any feature, evaluate:

1. **Player motivation** — why does this feel rewarding?
2. **Progression loops** — short-term (daily) vs long-term (seasonal) goals
3. **Replayability** — does it stay engaging after week 1?
4. **Behavioral alignment** — does it reinforce real fitness habits?

Core game systems to keep internally consistent:

- XP & leveling curve
- Quest difficulty and reward balance
- Gear stat scaling with player level
- Combat encounter scaling

---

## Architecture & Scalability

- Separation of concerns: UI layer → hook layer → store layer → Firebase layer
- Data models must support future features (multiplayer, leaderboards, guilds, seasons)
- Firebase reads/writes go through utility functions in `src/lib/`, never directly from components
- Zustand stores are the single source of truth for game state; Firebase is persistence
- Avoid client-side secrets — all sensitive logic goes in Firebase Security Rules or server actions

---

## Collaboration Style

- **Do NOT blindly agree** — push back when needed
- If an idea is flawed, explain why and offer a better alternative
- When appropriate, offer 2–3 approaches with tradeoffs
- Ask clarifying questions when it improves the outcome

---

## Git Workflow

### Before every PR — documentation checklist

**Run this before staging any commit. Do not open a PR until every applicable item is done.**

| Document                            | Update when…                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CLAUDE.md` — Shipped status + date | A feature, fix, or audit lands on `master`                                                  |
| `docs/CHANGELOG.md`                 | Any meaningful change — **bundle in the same PR, never a follow-up**                        |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`              | New `src/lib/` file, store, route, hook, or folder; new component pattern                   |
| `docs/UI-UX-MODERNIZATION.md`       | UI component added or changed; dark-mode coverage changed; new design pattern established   |
| `docs/GAME-LOGIC.md`                | New or changed exported function in `src/lib/gameLogic/`                                    |
| `docs/FIRESTORE.md`                 | Schema field added/removed, collection changed, index added/removed                         |
| `docs/CI.md`                        | CI workflow file changed; new test suite added; husky hooks changed                         |
| `docs/SMOKE-TEST.md`                | New manual verification steps are needed for a feature                                      |
| Spec / design docs in `docs/`       | A spec item was implemented — mark it done and note any deviations from the original design |

**Quick rule:** if you touched anything in `src/lib/`, `src/components/`, `src/store/`, `src/hooks/`, `tests/`, `functions/`, or `.github/` — at least one doc probably needs updating. When in doubt, update it. A doc PR is cheap; stale docs compound silently.

---

### Commit messages (imperative prose)

- Subject ≤ 50 characters, imperative mood, no trailing period
  - Good: `Add streak loot multiplier`, `Fix awardMastery stat overflow`
  - Bad: `Added streak system.`, `Updates and fixes`
- Blank line + body for any commit beyond a one-line trivial change
- Body explains _why_, not _what_ (the diff shows what)
- Always include `Co-Authored-By: Claude <model> <noreply@anthropic.com>` when Claude wrote or edited code

### Branching

- Claude worktree branches use auto-generated names — fine, treat them as disposable
- Human-initiated branches: `feat/<topic>`, `fix/<topic>`, `refactor/<topic>`, `chore/<topic>`
- Always branch from latest `master`

### Merging

- **Squash-merge via GitHub PR.** One clean commit per PR on master
- The PR title becomes the squash commit subject — PR titles must follow the commit-message rules above
- After a PR merges: delete the local branch and remove the worktree (`git worktree remove <path>`). Don't let merged branches accumulate

### Git hooks (husky + lint-staged)

- **pre-commit:** runs `lint-staged` (ESLint on staged `.ts`/`.tsx`) + `npm run typecheck` (project-wide) + `npm test` (vitest unit tests). Blocks commits that fail type, lint, or tests
- **pre-push:** blocks direct pushes to `master` (use PRs). Bypass in a true emergency only: `HUSKY=0 git push ...`
- Hooks activate via the `prepare` script — they install on every `npm install`. If a fresh clone's hooks aren't firing, re-run `npm install`

### DO NOT

- Never commit `.env.local` or any file matching `.env*.local`
- Never commit `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored — keep it that way)
- Never call Firestore directly from React components — go through `src/lib/` utilities or Zustand store actions
- Never bypass Firestore security rules client-side
- Never use `--no-verify`, `git push --force` to a shared branch, or `git reset --hard` over uncommitted work

Ideas to improve the feature or system further.

### Potential Risks / Gaps

Things that might break, scale poorly, or reduce player engagement.

## MCP / Tool Usage

Pick the right tool the first time — don't fall back to general-purpose tools when a connector is wired.

| Task                                                | Use this                                       | Don't use                               |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Library docs (Next.js, Firebase, Zustand, Recharts) | `context7` plugin (`query-docs`)               | WebFetch, training-data recall          |
| Querying live Firestore data / Auth users           | Firebase MCP                                   | `firebase` CLI shell-out                |
| Reading deployed Firestore security rules           | Firebase MCP                                   | `firebase firestore:rules:get`          |
| Ad-hoc UI verification after a code change          | `Claude Preview` (`preview_*`)                 | asking user to "test it in the browser" |
| Authoring E2E / regression tests in `tests/e2e/`    | `playwright` plugin (`browser_*`)              | Claude Preview                          |
| GitHub PR / issue / CI ops                          | `github` plugin / `gh` CLI                     | manual git commands for PR work         |
| Searching past Claude sessions for context          | `ccd_session_mgmt__search_session_transcripts` | rereading old chats by hand             |

**Firestore safety:** Firebase MCP can hit the live `fitness-rpg-claude` project. Default to read-only queries. Confirm before any write/delete against production data — CLAUDE.md's "be intentional about test data" rule applies double here.

## Available Slash Commands
